Our planet's weather patterns are intricately linked, but yet vast areas of the ocean still remain a meteorological mystery. This limited data hinders accurate weather forecasts, impacting everything from maritime safety to climate research. Current marine meteorological data collection infrastructure is plagued by challenges such as data integrity, reliability, and accessibility. Modern methods of data collection in maritime industry mainly refer to remote sensing (i.e., Copernicus Sentinel-6) with low sampling rates.

Our project is aimed to face these challenges by integrating smart contracts into the marine weather data collection.
By automating the execution and verification of maritime weather data directly within the blockchain, smart contracts ensure that data is collected, stored, and accessed in a manner that is both transparent and tamper-proof. This provides a framework for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of marine weather data.

Some examples of Smart Contract Use:
1.	Maritime Safety: If our weather stations detect hazardous weather conditions, a smart contract could automatically notify relevant parties, potentially integrating with navigation systems to suggest safer routes.

2.	Data Subscription: Offer a subscription model where users can pay to get real-time weather data feeds. Smart contracts can manage subscriptions and automate data access permissions based on payments.
